# Number-Guessing-Game-v2

This is a simple Number Guessing Game based on this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU5hjFxYpGA
I have modified the source code to include a limited number of guesses and account for invalid inputs such as string inputs.
I consider this project complete, however in the future I may make more modifications
For example, I have an idea to implement a 2-minute timer.
